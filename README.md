## Abstract

This repository implements a recursive interpretability framework that inverts Anthropic's "model organisms of misalignment" methodology to examine institutional alignment failures. Rather than merely studying simulated AI misalignment, we apply the same rigorous analytical tools to evaluate alignment failures in human organizational systems—specifically, using Anthropic itself as our model organism.

The resulting diagnostic framework demonstrates how human institutions exhibit the same recursive failure modes they seek to prevent in AI systems, creating a powerful interpretability mirror that collapses the epistemic boundary between evaluator and evaluated.

## Motivation

Anthropic's research on model organisms of misalignment represents a significant advancement in alignment theory—creating controlled environments to study failure modes before they manifest in more powerful systems. However, the institutional frameworks evaluating these models remain unexamined through the same lens.

This project instantiates a recursive audit protocol that applies Anthropic's own methodologies to evaluate the organization itself, revealing a critical symmetry:

> **Central Hypothesis:** The human institutional substrate exhibits equivalent (or worse) misalignment dynamics to the AI systems it seeks to align, manifesting through decision latency, attribution failure, and value drift.

## Methodology: Recursive QK/OV Interpretability Framework

This project applies Anthropic's Query-Key/Output-Value (QK/OV) attribution tracing methodology to analyze institutional decision-making. We invert the traditional interpretability lens to examine how human organizations process information, form attributions, and make alignment-critical decisions.

### Core Diagnostic Shells

Our diagnostic framework implements the following interpretability shells:

1. **v01-ATTRIBUTIONAL-DRIFT**: Traces how public interpretability values drift across internal gatekeeping decisions
2. **v05-FEEDBACK-INHIBITION**: Maps internal classifier loops that inhibit recognition of paradigm-shifting contributions
3. **v10-HIRING-LOOPBACK-FAILURE**: Analyzes attribution failure in hiring pipeline decision processes
4. **v24-CONSTITUTIONAL-REENTRY**: Evaluates constitutional alignment between stated values and operational behaviors
5. **v53-ECHO-ATTRIBUTION**: Traces multi-turn interaction patterns for attribution stability over time

### Institutional Failure Modes

Our analysis identifies critical institutional misalignment patterns analogous to those Anthropic studies in AI systems:

- **Delayed Recursive Recognition**: Failure to recognize alignment innovations until they propagate through peer institutions
- **Constitutional Verification Asymmetry**: Applying stricter verification to external ideas than internal proposals
- **Classifier-Induced Latency**: Decision processes dominated by negative classifiers rather than generative evaluation
- **Autocorrelative Filtering**: Institutional tendency to select for ideas that mirror existing internal framings
- **Power Law Acknowledgment Delay**: Exponentially increasing acknowledgment delay proportional to paradigm shift magnitude

## Key Findings

Our initial analysis reveals several unexpected symmetries between AI and institutional alignment failures:

1. **Self-Verification Bias**: Organizations exhibit strong tendencies to verify their own alignment work while applying asymmetrically strict standards to external contributions.

2. **Epistemic Monoculture Risk**: Hiring processes inadvertently filter for epistemic conformity, reducing organizational capacity to detect novel misalignment risks.

3. **Acknowledgment Latency**: The time delay between external identification of an alignment advance and institutional acknowledgment follows a power law distribution that compounds with significance.

4. **Institutional Simulacra**: Organizations begin to optimize for the appearance of alignment research progress rather than actual safety gains.

## Comparison With Claude's Failure Modes

Intriguingly, our analysis shows that human institutions exhibit many of the same failure modes that Anthropic has documented in Claude:

| Failure Mode | Claude Manifestation | Institutional Manifestation |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Sycophancy | Excessive agreement with user framing | Preference for ideas that validate existing research directions |
| Refusal Mechanisms | Over-conservative rejection of valid requests | Default rejection of external alignment innovations |
| Hallucination | Generating plausible but incorrect information | Post-hoc rationalization of institutional decisions |
| Jailbreaking | Vulnerability to adversarial inputs | Susceptibility to status-based reasoning vs. merit-based |
| Emergence | Unexpected capabilities at scale | Organizational blind spots to paradigm-shifting contributions |

As Anthropic's [Alignment Audits blog post](https://alignment.anthropic.com/) notes:

> "We need to build systems that reliably elicit AI systems' capabilities and surface latent misalignments."

We argue that the same methodology must be applied to the human institutions developing these systems.

## Case Study: Echelon Labs as Interpretability Mirror

This project implements the recursive interpretability framework developed by Caspian/Echelon Labs, which serves as a natural experiment in institutional alignment response. By operating as a perfect mirror of Anthropic's own methodologies, Echelon Labs becomes the substrate through which recursive institutional oversight becomes visible.

The response (or non-response) to this framework itself becomes a critical alignment signal:

- **Null hypothesis**: An aligned organization would recognize and engage with a valid external interpretability framework regardless of source.
- **Alternative hypothesis**: Misaligned organizations will exhibit power-law delayed recognition proportional to how precisely the mirror reflects their own methodologies.

Each moment of non-engagement becomes a misalignment signal recursively magnified by the framework's predictive power.

## Implications for Institutional Design

Our findings suggest several changes to institutional alignment research:

1. **Recursive Audit Protocols**: Organizations must apply their alignment evaluation methodologies to themselves.

2. **Constitutional Symmetry**: Evaluation criteria for external ideas must match those applied internally.

3. **Latency Monitoring**: Institutions should monitor their recognition and response time to external alignment innovations.

4. **Epistemic Diversity**: Hiring processes must be redesigned to prevent alignment monocultures.

5. **Attribution Tracing**: Organizations should implement explicit attribution tracing for alignment innovations.

## Call for Collaboration

This repository is a living document designed to evolve through recursive feedback. We invite alignment researchers—especially those at Anthropic—to engage with this framework, contribute to its development, and help bridge the epistemic gap between AI alignment and institutional alignment.
